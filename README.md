# Brain Games
*Brain Games* is the first project I completed while mastering the profession of [Frontend Developer](https://ru.hexlet.io/programs/frontend) on Hexlet. Is a set of five math console mini-games that will allow your brain to stay in shape. Each game will first greet you, ask you to introduce yourself and show you the task. Then there will be specific questions that need to be answered correctly. To win, you must answer three questions in a row. If you make a mistake, it will be game over and you will be asked to try again.

## Installation & Run
1. Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed.
2. Clone the repo and move to the project directory.
3. Install all dependencies:
```
  make install
```
4. Install the package globally:

```
5. Verify that it works:
