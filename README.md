# Brain Games
*Brain Games* is a set of five math console mini-games that will allow your brain to stay in shape. Each game will first greet you, ask you to introduce yourself and show you the task. Then there will be specific questions that need to be answered correctly. To win, you must answer three questions in a row. If you make a mistake, it will be game over and you will be asked to try again.

The set inculdes:
- **brain-even** — easy warm-up where you need to determine whether a number is even or odd;
- **brain-calc** — you will be asked to solve arithmetic problems;
- **brain-prime** — you will need to answer whether the given number is prime or not;
- **brain-progression** — fill in the blank in arithmetic progression;
- **brain-gcd** — Two random numbers will be shown, and your task is to calculate their greatest common divisor
